#  Energy-Load-Forecaster (ELF)

**Accurate short-term load forecasting for smarter, greener buildings.**

##  Elevator Pitch
*"Smarter buildings, greener future: short-term load forecasting powered by Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs)."*

##  About the Project

###  Inspiration
One morning, while enjoying the peace and tranquility on my terrace, listening to the birds and sipping juice, I was suddenly disturbed by the roar of a generator producing thick smoke. Frustrated, I started researching how buildings consume energy and rely on inefficient backup systems. That’s when I realized how crucial **efficient energy management** is.  
When this hackathon presented a problem statement directly addressing this issue, I felt motivated to build a solution.

###  What It Does
The **Energy-Load-Forecaster (ELF)** predicts **short-term energy consumption** for buildings using advanced **TSFMs** combined with contextual factors like:
- Historical energy records  
- Weather conditions (temperature, humidity)  
- Day type (weekday/weekend/holiday)  

It also integrates **anomaly detection** to identify abnormal usage patterns, which can point to:
- Equipment malfunctions  
- Inefficiencies  
- Aberrant user behavior  

---

###  How I Built It
- Designed a pipeline integrating **TSFMs** with building metadata and environmental factors.  
- Used **time-series modeling** to capture temporal dependencies.  
- Incorporated anomaly detection for abnormal consumption patterns.  
- Built everything solo, from research to implementation.  

---

###  Challenges I Faced
- Handling noisy and incomplete energy datasets.  
- Integrating external conditions (weather/day type) with time-series inputs.  
- Understanding the complexities of **TSFM fine-tuning** for domain-specific data.  
- Building the entire pipeline alone within hackathon constraints.  

---

###  Accomplishments
- Developed a flexible, scalable framework for **short-term load forecasting**.  
- Designed an **anomaly detection system** for real-world building monitoring.  
- Created a project that directly contributes to **decarbonization goals**.  

---

###  What I Learned
- Deeper understanding of **time-series forecasting** and **foundation models**.  
- Importance of **external contextual data** in improving model accuracy.  
- How anomaly detection complements forecasting for robust energy management.  
- The value of building resilient solutions that scale across geographies.  

---

###  What’s Next for ELF
- Deploy ELF as a **cloud-based service** for real-time building monitoring.  
- Expand dataset integration to include **smart meters** and **IoT devices**.  
- Collaborate with organizations to test ELF in **real-world pilot projects**.  
- Optimize for **renewable energy integration** and **carbon footprint reduction**.
